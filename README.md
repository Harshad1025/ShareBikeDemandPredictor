# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction ðŸš²ðŸ“ˆ

## Project Summary

The "Bike Seoul" initiative in South Korea aims to provide sustainable urban transportation through bike sharing services. Our project focuses on predicting bike rental demand in Seoul using machine learning techniques. Leveraging historical data and factors like weather conditions and time of day, we developed regression models to forecast demand patterns.

## Key Insights

- **Temporal Trends:** Morning and evening peak hours observed, indicating commuting patterns.
- **Seasonal Variation:** Winter months saw reduced demand, suggesting weather dependence.
- **Feature Importance:** Variables such as temperature, functioning day, humidity significantly influenced demand.
- **Model Performance:** XGBoost algorithm achieved high accuracy, enabling real-time demand prediction.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains dataset files sourced from the Seoul city government's open data portal and Kaggle.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model development.
- `models/`: Trained machine learning models saved for deployment.
- `scripts/`: Helper scripts for data processing and model evaluation.
